Reconstruct 3D models from line clouds generated by multi-view images.

You can download the dataset through Google Drive: [Line2Buiding Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/172dIp7-UXDMvKA4Enj_mFWbJJfMTFFoC?usp=sharing). The corresponding multi-view images and point clouds data are also available if required.

The ratio of training data and test data is 9:1. We randomly select 200 buildings to serve as test data.
